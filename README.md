Hash Security Project
This project focuses on enhancing password security through custom hashing methods. It includes three primary functions: private_password, deviate, and pass_shuff. These functions aim to transform and obscure passwords to improve their security against attacks.

Features
  * Private Password Generation (private_password):
  * Combines elements from a username and a password to create a unique, private password.
  * Alternates characters from the username and password, ensuring a more complex result.

Password Deviation (deviate):
  * Transforms a given password using a custom shuffling method based on ASCII printable characters.
  * Increases password complexity by mapping characters to a shuffled list.

Password Shuffling (pass_shuff):
  * Rearranges the characters of a password to further obscure its original form.
  * Uses a left and right index alternation approach to shuffle the characters effectively.
